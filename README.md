The working system of this tool is the power supply will first provide power and watch the ESP32. The ESP32 which has been in the ON condition will start initiating a wifi network that has been set with the SSID and password via the program, as well as initiating the RTC and rotating the LCD. When the initiation process WiFi has been completed and WiFi has been connected with ESP32, then read the value from the Magnetic Reed Sensor on the ARG will begin to be recorded and displayed on the LCD screen and can be accessed on the Web/App so that it can be monitored in real-time. The reading of the value using the Magnetic Reed Sensor is done by counting the number of tip movements that occur during the rain.
